/**
 * Template Bindings native features enables a wide-range of use cases,
 * but (by design) don't attempt to implement a wide array of specialized
 * behaviors.
 *
 * Enabling these features is a matter of implementing and registering a
 * BindingDelegate. A binding delegate is an object which contains one or more
 * delegation functions which implement specialized behavior. This object is
 * registered via [TemplateBindExtension.bindingDelegate]:
 *
 * HTML:
 *     <template bind>
 *       {{ What!Ever('crazy')->thing^^^I+Want(data) }}
 *     </template>
 *
 * Dart:
 *     class MySyntax extends BindingDelegate {
 *       prepareBinding(path, name, node) {
 *         // The magic happens here!
 *       }
 *     }
 *     ...
 *     templateBind(query('template'))
 *         ..bindingDelegate = new MySyntax()
 *         ..model = new MyModel();
 *
 *
 * See
 * <http://www.polymer-project.org/platform/template.html#binding-delegate-api>
 * for more information about the binding delegate.
