  // http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:observe#object.deliverchangerecords
  //
  // The rationale for that, and for async delivery in general, is the principal
  // that you shouldn't run code (observers) when it doesn't expect to be run.
  // If you do that, you risk violating invariants that the code assumes.
  //
  // For this reason, we need to match the ES Harmony version. The way we can do
  // this in Dart is to add a method on StreamSubscription (possibly by
  // subclassing Stream* types) that immediately delivers records for only
  // that subscription. Alternatively, we could consider using something other
  // than Stream to deliver the multicast change records, and provide an
  // Observable->Stream adapter.
  //
  // Also: we should be delivering changes to the observer (subscription) based
  // on the birth order of the observer. This is for compatibility with ES
  // Harmony as well as predictability for app developers.
