/**
 * This provides a general-purpose serialization facility for Dart objects. A
 * [Serialization] is defined in terms of [SerializationRule]s and supports
 * reading and writing to different formats.
 *
 * ## Installing ##
 *
 * Use [pub][] to install this package. Add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`
 * file.
 *
 *     dependencies:
 *       serialization: any
 *
 * Then run `pub install`.
 *
 * For more information, see the
 * [serialization package on pub.dartlang.org][pkg].
 *
 * Setup
 * =====
 * A simple example of usage is
 *
 *      var address = new Address();
 *      address.street = 'N 34th';
 *      address.city = 'Seattle';
 *      var serialization = new Serialization()
 *          ..addRuleFor(address);
 *      Map output = serialization.write(address);
 *
 * This creates a new serialization and adds a rule for address objects. Right
 * now it has to be passed an address instance because of limitations using
 * Address as a literal. Then we ask the [Serialization] to write the address
 * and we get back a Map which is a [json]able representation of the state of
 * the address and related objects. Note that while the output in this case
 * is a [Map], the type will vary depending on which output format we've told
 * the [Serialization] to use.
 *
 * The version above used reflection to automatically identify the public
 * fields of the address object. We can also specify those fields explicitly.
 *
 *      var serialization = new Serialization()
 *        ..addRuleFor(address,
 *            constructor: "create",
 *            constructorFields: ["number", "street"],
 *            fields: ["city"]);
 *
 * This rule still uses reflection to access the fields, but does not try to
 * identify which fields to use, but instead uses only the "number" and "street"
 * fields that we specified. We may also want to tell it to identify the
 * fields, but to specifically omit certain fields that we don't want
 * serialized.
 *
 *      var serialization = new Serialization()
 *        ..addRuleFor(address,
 *            constructor: "",
 *            excludeFields: ["other", "stuff"]);
 *
 * Writing Rules
 * =============
 * We can also use a completely non-reflective rule to serialize and
 * de-serialize objects. This can be more work, but it does work in
 * dart2js, where mirrors are not yet implemented. We can specify this in two
 * ways. First, we can write our own SerializationRule class that has methods
 * for our Address class.
 *
 *      class AddressRule extends CustomRule {
 *        bool appliesTo(instance, Writer w) => instance.runtimeType == Address;
 *        getState(instance) => [instance.street, instance.city];
 *        create(state) => new Address();
 *        setState(Address a, List state) {
 *          a.street = state[0];
 *          a.city = state[1];
 *        }
 *      }
 *
 * The class needs four different methods. The [CustomRule.appliesTo]
 * method tells us if
 * the rule should be used to write an object. In this example we use a test
 * based on runtimeType. We could also use an "is Address" test, but if Address
 * has subclasses that would find those as well, and we want a separate rule
 * for each. The [CustomRule.getState] method should
 * return all the state of the object that we want to recreate,
 * and should be either a Map or a List. If you want to write to human-readable
 * formats where it's useful to be able to look at the data as a map from
 * field names to values, then it's better to return it as a map. Otherwise it's
 * more efficient to return it as a list. You just need to be sure that the
 * [CustomRule.create] and [CustomRule.setState] methods interpret the data the
 * same way as [CustomRule.getState] does.
 *
 * The [CustomRule.create] method will create the new object and return it. While it's
 * possible to create the object and set all its state in this one method, that
 * increases the likelihood of problems with cycles. So it's better to use the
 * minimum necessary information in [CustomRule.create] and do more of the work
 * in [CustomRule.setState].
 *
 * The other way to do this is not creating a subclass, but by using a
 * [ClosureRule] and giving it functions for how to create
 * the address.
 *
 *      addressToMap(a) => {"number" : a.number, "street" : a.street,
 *          "city" : a.city};
 *      createAddress(Map m) => new Address.create(m["number"], m["street"]);
 *      fillInAddress(Address a, Map m) => a.city = m["city"];
 *      var serialization = new Serialization()
 *        ..addRule(
 *            new ClosureRule(anAddress.runtimeType,
 *                addressToMap, createAddress, fillInAddress);
 *
 * In this case we have created standalone functions rather than
 * methods in a subclass and we pass them to the constructor of
 * [ClosureRule]. In this case we've also had them use maps rather than
 * lists for the state, but either would work as long as the rule is
 * consistent with the representation it uses. We pass it the runtimeType
 * of the object, and functions equivalent to the methods on [CustomRule]
 *
 * Constant Values
 * ===============
 * There are cases where the constructor needs values that we can't easily get
 * from the serialized object. For example, we may just want to pass null, or a
 * constant value. To support this, we can specify as constructor fields
 * values that aren't field names. If any value isn't a String, or is a string
 * that doesn't correspond to a field name, it will be
 * treated as a constant and passed unaltered to the constructor.
 *
 * In some cases a non-constructor field should not be set using field
 * access or a setter, but should be done by calling a method. For example, it
 * may not be possible to set a List field "foo", and you need to call an
 * addFoo() method for each entry in the list. In these cases, if you are using
 * a BasicRule for the object you can call the setFieldWith() method.
 *
 *       s..addRuleFor(fooHolderInstance).setFieldWith("foo",
 *           (parent, value) => for (var each in value) parent.addFoo(value));
 *
 * Writing
 * =======
 * To write objects, we use the write() method.
 *
 *       var output = serialization.write(someObject);
 *
 * By default this uses a representation in which objects are represented as
 * maps keyed by field name, but in which references between objects have been
 * converted into Reference objects. This is then typically encoded as
 * a [json] string, but can also be used in other ways, e.g. sent to another
 * isolate.
 *
 * We can write objects in different formats by passing a [Format] object to
 * the [Serialization.write] method or by getting a [Writer] object.
 * The available formats
 * include the default, a simple "flat" format that doesn't include field names,
 * and a simple JSON format that produces output more suitable for talking to
 * services that expect JSON in a predefined format. Examples of these are
 *
 *      Map output = serialization.write(address, new SimpleMapFormat());
 *      List output = serialization.write(address, new SimpleFlatFormat());
 *      var output = serialization.write(address, new SimpleJsonFormat());
 * Or, using a [Writer] explicitly
 *      var writer = serialization.newWriter(new SimpleFlatFormat());
 *      List output = writer.write(address);
 *
 * These representations are not yet considered stable.
 *
 * Reading
 * =======
 * To read objects, the corresponding [Serialization.read] method can be used.
 *
 *       Address input = serialization.read(input);
 *
 * When reading, the serialization instance doing the reading must be configured
 * with compatible rules to the one doing the writing. It's possible for the
 * rules to be different, but they need to be able to read the same
 * representation. For most practical purposes right now they should be the
 * same. The simplest way to achieve this is by having the serialization
 * variable [Serialization.selfDescribing] be true. In that case the rules
 * themselves are also
 * stored along with the serialized data, and can be read back on the receiving
 * end. Note that this may not work for all rules or all formats. The
 * [Serialization.selfDescribing] variable is true by default, but the
 * [SimpleJsonFormat] does not support it, since the point is to provide a
 * representation in a form
 * other services might expect. Using CustomRule or ClosureRule also does not
 * yet work with the [Serialization.selfDescribing] variable.
 *
 * Named Objects
 * =============
 * When reading, some object references should not be serialized, but should be
 * connected up to other instances on the receiving side. A notable example of
 * this is when serialization rules have been stored. Instances of BasicRule
 * take a [ClassMirror] in their constructor, and we cannot serialize those. So
 * when we read the rules, we must provide a Map<String, Object> which maps from
 * the simple name of classes we are interested in to a [ClassMirror]. This can
 * be provided either in the [Serialization.namedObjects],
 * or as an additional parameter to the reading and writing methods on the
 * [Reader] or [Writer] respectively.
 *
 *     new Serialization()
 *       ..addRuleFor(new Person(), constructorFields: ["name"])
 *       ..namedObjects['Person'] = reflect(new Person()).type;
